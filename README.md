# Portfolio
Data science portfolio.
Welcome to my data science portfolio! Please take a look around to get an idea of my Python and data science capabilities.

My current project is an attempt to predict violent crime rates based on income, metropolitan vs nonmetropolitan areas, and population size. The project is not complete, but it should show clear examples of data cleaning / preprocessing, feature scaling, multiple linear regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, XGBoost, and even a basic neural network. After testing these different models with a test set, I applied K-Fold Cross Validation to find the accuracy and standard deviation of the models. In the future I plan to also apply grid search to fine tune the models, but I am more focused in finding better predictive variables. If I find enough variables that dimensionality is an issue, I will apply backward elimination to select the most predictive features.
